# Setup instructions

You will find the instructions to set up your computer for your next React Native Bootcamp.

- ðŸ’¡ I do provide advice for [Linux and macOS](https://davidl.fr/blog/react-native-setup).
- ðŸ’¡ Being an **administrator on windows is mandatory**, I am **not responsible** if you encounter issues.

## System Requirements

- [ ] [git](https://git-scm.com/) v2.40 or greater
- [ ] [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v18 or greater

Use the following command from your terminal to check your Node version.

```console
node --version
```

If you have a recent version installed, it should do.

## Virtual Simulators

<details>
<summary>macOS</summary>

- [ ] [Xcode](https://apps.apple.com/fr/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) for macOS

Check if everything is working.

```console
xcode-select --install
```

To accept terms and conditions

```console
xcode-select -p
```

Should output something like `/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer` if it's not the case run `sudo xcode-select --reset`

- [ ] [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with API levels 21+

## Smartphone Requirements

`iOS` phones are the easiest way, Android is nice too BUT there are more issues. You need a decent smartphone to enjoy a fast experience.
