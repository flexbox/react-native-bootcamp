# React Native Ecosystem

## 📡 What you will learn

- Let your computer catch errors **BEFORE** you ship bugs

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

Organise your files in a **good way**. Here is an example:

```console
.
├── App.tsx
├── app.json
├── assets
│    ├── adaptive-icon.png
│    ├── favicon.png
│    ├── icon.png
│    └── splash.png
├── babel.config.js
├── package.json
├── src
│    ├── components
│    │    ├── AppLayout.tsx
│    │    ├── Offline.tsx
│    │    ├── Card.tsx
│    │    └── index.tsx
│    ├── lib
│    │    └── fetchAsync.ts
│    └── screens
│          ├── LoginScreen.tsx
│          ├── TermsScreen.tsx
│          ├── StarshipFeedScreen.tsx
│          └── index.tsx
├── tsconfig.json
└── yarn.lock
```

- [ ] Create a `./src/components/` folder and move all your components here
- [ ] Create a `./src/components/index.tsx` file and exports your components

```javascript
import AppLayout from './AppLayout';
import Offline from './Offline';
import Card from './Card';

export { AppLayout, Offline, Card };
```

If you don't do that you can have exporting errors.

```javascript
// without and index
import Card from './components/Card';

// without exported index.tsx
import { Card } from './components/Card';
```

☝ This choice is not opiniated.

```javascript
// We have 2 ways to write our components

const Card = () => {
  ...
}

// or

function Card(){
  ...
}
```

Choose a solution and keep it concistent accross your stack.

BUT there is a nice pattern to know: **renaming a component on the go**

- [ ] Create a `./src/screens/` folder and move all your previsous Screens here
- [ ] Create a `./src/screens/index.tsx` file and exports your components
- [ ] On `App.tsx`

```javascript
// App.tsx

import { LoginScreen as App } from './src/screens/LoginScreen';
export default App;
```

👏 Now you are a naming expert!

We are ready to dive on TypeScript. The [Typescript cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react) may help you one day.

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3

> TypeScript has own components and own snippets. Use search or just type ts before every component snippet.

- [ ] Use `tsrnfe` to create/update your components and move them to `./src/components/`
- [ ] Add `interface` declarations on your components

**Hint:** Here is an example with a `StarshipCard` component with 4 props `name` `model` `manufacturer` and `cost_in_credits` they are all definied in `string` because that's what we get from the api.

```typescript
interface StarshipCardProps {
  name: string;
  model: string;
  manufacturer: string;
  cost_in_credits: string;
}
```

## 👽 Bonus

- [ ] Install `babel-plugin-module-resolver` to add [an alias for imports](https://sterlingcobb.medium.com/adding-alias-to-create-react-native-app-crna-in-2-minutes-45574f4a7729)
