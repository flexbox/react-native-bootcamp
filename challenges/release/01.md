## 👾 Before we start the exercise

Visit [expo.dev/eas](https://expo.dev/eas) and Sign up to start using EAS. The free plan already includes everything you need if you are an indie hacker working on your own apps.

In addition, to release in production to the stores, you need to have an account for:

- iOS on [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/) _$99 per year_
- Android on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/console/developers) _$30 one time payment_

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 1

### Setup

To use EAS, you will need to install the `eas-cli` package globally. Go to your terminal and run the following command.

```console
npm i -g eas-cli
eas login
```

#### Init

```console
eas init
✔ Linked to project @weshipit/spacecraft
✔ Linked app.json to project with ID 012aaaa3-4ce5-4bae-9f4d-2f842489f07a
```

### Build

Create [your first build](https://docs.expo.dev/build/setup/).

```console
eas build:configure
```

![EAS Build configuration Done](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/release/eas-build-configure.png)

After finishing this configuration. You will get a new `eas.json` file in the root directory of your current project.

```console
eas build
✔ Select platform › Android
✔ Linked to project @weshipit/spacecraft
✔ Using remote Android credentials (Expo server)
```

⌛ 30 min

On your [Expo account](https://expo.dev), you should have someting like this:

![Expo internal distribution build done](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/release/ios-build-done.png)

### Submitting your app to the store

```console
eas submit
✔ Select platform › Android
✔ Linked to project @weshipit/spacecraft
```

EAS will use your latest build for the submission by default, but you can manually specify a previous build if you want.

If you are stuck, run `eas submit --help` from the terminal to get informations.
