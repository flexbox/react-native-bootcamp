# Configuration and Environment variables

## üì° What you will learn

- [Difference between development builds](https://blog.expo.dev/development-builds-are-out-of-preview-7e5b1979f84b) with `expo-dev-client` and Expo Go.
- Configuring development and production variants in a managed project.
- Using `.env` files to [manage your environment variables](https://expo.dev/blog/what-are-environment-variables).

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- [Check this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw8FAUftJFU) to understand what is the difference between Expo Go and Expo Custom Development Client.

In this challenge we are going to put everything in place that you can have these variants on your app (Dev and production)

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 2

Following the [documentation to add variants to your application](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/variants/#example-configuring-development-and-production-variants-in):

- [ ] create your `app.config.js` to use in your **managed project**
  - add a custom name for your dev app

Let's say now you want to have differents API endpoints. You can use [environment variables](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/environment-variables/) to do that. Don't forget to follow the [`.env` convention](https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv/blob/c6e583a/README.md#what-other-env-files-can-i-use).

- [ ] create a `.env.local` file and add your environment variables.

```console
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://swapi.py4e.com/
```

- [ ] use `process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` to call the Star Wars API in your app.

In real situations, you may have multiple enpoints depending on the environment. Here is how [you can set differents build profiles](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/variables/#setting-plaintext-environment-variables-in-easjson).

üî• Never commit sensitive information!

If you want to store secret key in your repository like `SENTRY_API_KEY`, you can [use EAS Secrets](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/variables/#using-secrets-in-environment-variables).

To create a new secret, run :

```console
eas env
```

```console
eas env:create  // create a new secret
eas env:list    // view any existing secrets for this project
```

- [ ] use `eas env:create` and create a fake `SWAPI_KEY` because there is no API key for the Star Wars API.

In the next lesson, we are going to build your app and show you how to install it on your phone.

## üëΩ Bonus

- [ ] Check [with-env config](https://github.com/betomoedano/with-environments/blob/main/app.config.ts) and update your `app.config` file.
- [ ] Create new icons like [with-env icons](https://github.com/betomoedano/with-environments/tree/main/assets/images/icons) to have a custom icon for your dev app.
