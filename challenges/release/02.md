## 📡 What you will learn

- [Difference between development builds](https://blog.expo.dev/development-builds-are-out-of-preview-7e5b1979f84b) with `expo-dev-client` and Expo Go.
- Configuring development and production variants in a managed project.

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- [Check this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iw8FAUftJFU) to understand what is the difference between Expo Go and Expo Custom Development Client.

In this challenge we are going to put everything in place that you can have these variants on your app (Dev and production)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2

Following the [documentation to add variants to your application](https://docs.expo.dev/build-reference/variants/#example-configuring-development-and-production-variants-in):

- [ ] create your `app.config.js` to use in your **managed project**
  - add a custom name for your dev app

## 👽 Bonus

- [ ] Add a custom icon for your dev app

Use [App-icon-badge](https://github.com/obytes/app-icon-badge) and update your `app.config.js` to have a custom icon for your dev app.

In the next lesson, we are going to build your app and show you how to install it on your phone.
