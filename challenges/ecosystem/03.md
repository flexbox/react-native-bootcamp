## üì° What you will learn

- Let your computer catch errors as you code and **BEFORE** you ship bugs to production
- Create documentation for your team

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

> **`TypeScript` is fantastic to use with React** because it can help us catch a lot of bugs we wouldn't catch otherwise. It helps our team **have good documentation** and it **makes React easier to use**.

- [ ] Watch this [video about the story of `TypeScript`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUlM3wx546o) to understand why it's a:
  - language
  - linter
  - compiler
  - documentation tool
  - even Bill Gates use it

### Typing functionnal components with `TypeScript`

The main concept of `TypeScript` is to define the "shape" of our `props` with types. `TypeScript` will ensure that everything conforms to the right "shape" in our code.

Here's the `interface` we are going to use:

```javascript
interface StarshipCardProps {
  name: string;
  model: string;
  manufacturer: string;
  cost_in_credits: string;
}
```

**üî≠ Hint:** we are using [`interface` over `type`](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Performance#preferring-interfaces-over-intersections) because it's more performant during the compilation. But you can use both for now.

### Adding Props type

How can we add the "shape" of our component? You probably have something like this

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Card } from "react-native-paper";

export function StarshipCard(props) {
  const { name, model, manufacturer, cost_in_credits } = props;
  return <Card>...</Card>;
}
```

You need to add a new argument to your `props` declaration. Our component have 4 props `name` `model` `manufacturer` and `cost_in_credits`.

_They are all defined in `string` because that's what we get from the api._

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Card } from "react-native-paper";

interface StarshipCardProps {
  name: string;
  model: string;
  manufacturer: string;
  cost_in_credits: string;
}

export function StarshipCard(props: StarshipCardProps) {
  const { name, model, manufacturer, cost_in_credits } = props;
  return <Card>...</Card>;
}
```

### Destructuring pattern

And because you are killing it, you can use the **destructuring pattern** like this:

```javascript
import React from "react";
import { Card } from "react-native-paper";

interface StarshipCardProps {
  name: string;
  model: string;
  manufacturer: string;
  cost_in_credits: string;
}

export function StarshipCard({
  name,
  model,
  manufacturer,
  cost_in_credits,
}: StarshipCardProps) {
  // No extra line here, like in thre previous example
  return <Card>...</Card>;
}
```

**üî≠ Hint:** Not familiar with destructuring? [have a look at the patterns page](https://davidl.fr/workshop/patterns#destructuring-props).

### Do you need a translation?

- I was like you ‚Äîwhen I started using `TypeScript`‚Äî feeling lost. You can bookmark the [Typescript cheatsheet](https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react), it will may help you to answer all your questions.
- Reading TypeScript error can be confusing, if you need help you can copy/paste your error in [`ts-error-translator`](https://ts-error-translator.vercel.app/)

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 3

- [ ] Use the shortcut `tsrnfe` to create/update your components and move them to `./src/components/`
- [ ] Add `interface` declarations for your components
