# Unit Testing with React Native

## 📡 What you will learn

- Write maintainable unit tests with good testing practices.
- Use React Native Testing Library (`RNTL`) —a lightweight solution for testing React Native components.

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

Unit tests cover the smallest parts of code, like individual functions or components.

We are writing unit tests to avoid regressions over time. Creating a brand new app is easy, maintaining it over time is way more complex.

> `RNTL` is a very light-weight solution for testing without all the implementation details. The main utilities it provides involve querying for nodes similarly to how users would find them. In this way, testing-library helps ensure your tests give you confidence in your UI code.

- Check [`RNTL` documentation](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/docs/getting-started)

### How to write your first test

The main concept is to test how your user will "see" your application and ensure your component renders correctly.

Here's an example of a `*.test.tsx` file:

```javascript
describe('', () => {
  it('', () => {

  });
});
```

### Adding description

We will test if `Header.test.tsx` renders correctly:

```javascript
// Header.test.tsx

describe('Header', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {

  });
});
```

### Render the component

You need to `render` the component you want to test with `props` declaration.

```javascript
// Header.test.tsx

import { render } from "@testing-library/react-native";
import React from "react";

import { Header } from "~/components/Header";

describe("Header", () => {
  it("renders correctly", () => {
    render(<Header title="SpaceCraft" />);

  });
});
```

### Debug the component

The first time you can use `debug()` to print rendered component.

```javascript
// Header.test.tsx

import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react-native";
import React from "react";

import { Header } from "~/components/Header";

describe("Header", () => {
  it("renders correctly", () => {
    render(<Header title="SpaceCraft" />);

    screen.debug();
  });
});
```

### Automatically detect if text is rendered

`getByText` is the method used to find any visible text on interactive and non-interactive elements —like a user will "see" our component.

```javascript
// Header.test.tsx

import { render, screen } from "@testing-library/react-native";
import React from "react";

import { Header } from "~/components/Header";

describe("Header", () => {
  it("renders correctly", () => {
    render(<Header title="SpaceCraft" />);

    screen.getByText("SpaceCraft");
  });
});
```

Check if your test are passing with `npm run test`.

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 5

### Setup Jest

- [ ] Install the Jest package, as well as an Expo-specific Jest preset package:

```console
expo install jest-expo jest
```

Update `package.json` with a new script to run Jest

```diff
   "scripts": {
     "start": "expo start",
     "android": "expo start --android",
     "ios": "expo start --ios",
--    "web": "expo start --web"
++    "web": "expo start --web",
++    "test": "jest"
   },
++  "jest": {
++    "preset": "jest-expo"
++  },
```

Double check if Jest is working properly from the terminal.

- [ ] Create a new file called `hello.test.ts` and paste this working test

```javascript
// ./src/utils/hello.test.ts

it("works", () => {
  expect(1).toBe(1);
});
```

When you run `yarn test` you should have this result

```console
yarn run v1.22.17
$ jest
 PASS  src/utils/hello.test.ts

Test Suites: 3 passed, 3 total
Tests:       3 passed, 3 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        7.029 s
Ran all test suites.
✨  Done in 16.14s.
```

### Installing React Native Testing Library

- [ ] [Install `RNTL`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-testing-library/) with `yarn`

```console
npm install --save-dev @testing-library/react-native
```

- [ ] Next you need to configure a jest setup file using `setupFilesAfterEnv` to your `package.json`

```diff
  "jest": {
    "preset": "jest-expo",
++    "setupFilesAfterEnv": [
++      "<rootDir>/jest.setup.js"
++    ]
  },
```

- [ ] Add the following line to `jest.setup.js` to extend Jest's expect with the `RNTL` matchers

```javascript
// jest.setup.js

import '@testing-library/jest-native/extend-expect';
```

Let's now create a workflow to quickly add units tests on your codebase.

- [ ] update `package.json` with a param to watch the file we change

```diff
// package.json

  "test": "jest",
++  "test:unit:watch": "jest --watch"
```

Now you can run `yarn test:unit:watch` to watch your files and run tests automatically.

### Testing a component

- [ ] Create tests files for your components
