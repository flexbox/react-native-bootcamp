# Exercise 6: End-to-End Testing with Maestro

## 📡 What you will learn

- Set up end-to-end (E2E) tests for your React Native application.
- Use Maestro to write and run automated E2E tests.

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

End-to-end (E2E) testing involves testing the complete functionality of an application from the user's perspective, ensuring all components work together as expected.

Maestro is a library for automating user interactions in your React Native app, allowing you to write and run E2E tests.

- Check the [Maestro documentation](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro).

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 6

### Setting Up Maestro

- [ ] Install Maestro

Follow the [getting started guide](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro) to install Maestro on your laptop.

### Writing Your First Test

1. **Create a Tests Folder**:
  - [ ] At the root of your project, create a `e2e` folder.

2. **Create a Test File**:
  - [ ] Create a file named `process.yaml` in the `e2e` folder.

3. **Add Maestro Script**:
  - [ ] Add the following script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "e2e": "maestro test e2e/process.yaml"
}
```

4. **Write Your Test**:
  - [ ] Write a test in the `process.yaml` file.

  You should have something like this:

```yaml
appId: host.exp.Exponent
---

- launchApp
- tapOn: "Email"
- inputText: "test@gmail.com"
- tapOn: "Password"
- inputText: "123456"
- tapOn: "Login"
- waitFor: "Welcome"
- tapOn: "Buy this ship"
- tapOn: "Confirm"
``` 

### Running Your Test

1. **Run Your Test**:
  - [ ] Run your test by lanching your project on a simulator and executing the following command:

```console
npm run maestro
```

2. **Check the Results**:
  You should see the test running on your simulator.

### 👽 Bonus

- [ ] Write more tests for your application.
- [ ] Explore Maestro's documentation to learn more about its capabilities.
- [ ] Write a more complex test that involves `testID`s.
