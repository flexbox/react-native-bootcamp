# Passing datas though Screens

## 📡 What you will learn

- Read `params` from the `route` props.

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- Check the [`route` prop documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/route-prop).
- Do you remeber how to [pass to the destination route](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/navigation-prop#common-api-reference)?

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2

### Navigating to another screens with `params`

Go to `src/screens/StarshipFeedScreen.tsx`:

- [ ] The header title for this view should be `Starships`.
- [ ] Update `Routes.ts` and `Navigator.tsx` to add a new screen called `STARSHIP_DETAIL_SCREEN`.
- [ ] Implement `handlePress` function to send the user to `STARSHIP_DETAIL_SCREEN`, passing the `starship` data as parameters.

### Create a details screen

- [ ] Go and create `src/screens/StarshipDetailsScreen.tsx`:

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-navigation/details-screen.png" alt="react-navigation details screen" width="50%" height="50%" />

Each screen component in your app is provided with the `route` prop automatically.

- [ ] Read the `params` of the screen and display the `starship` data.

You can use these component to make it pretty:

- [`DataTable`](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/docs/components/DataTable/)
- [List.Section](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/docs/components/List/ListSection)
- [Chip](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/docs/components/Chip/)

## 👽 Bonus

- [ ] Change the `screenOptions` to display your screen as a `modal`.
- [ ] Add a "close modal" Button with an icon.
