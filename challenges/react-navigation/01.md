# Stack Navigator

## 📡 What you will learn

- Organise your routes and name your screens.
- How to use the `react-navigation` library with the `navigation` prop.

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- There are others routing solutions available, keep in mind **we are using [`react-navigation` library](https://reactnavigation.org/)**.
- We are using the last version of `react-navigation` (_Be carreful when you randomly copy/paste Stack Overflow_).
- TypeScript definitions are a bit complicated with `react-navigation`, for now just ignore them.

Here is a preview of our application user flow:

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 1

### Installation

- [ ] Read the [Getting started](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started/#installation) guide to:
  1. Install the required packages in your React Native project.
  1. Install dependencies into an Expo managed project.

**Hint:** you just installed **the core packages**, for every type of navigator (`Native Stack`, `Drawer`, `Bottom Tabs`…) you will need to **install other packages**.

### Create a Navigator file

- [ ] Create a new component called `Navigator.tsx` on `./src/navigation/Routes.ts` and update the **entry point of your application**, such as `App.tsx`.
- [ ] Wrap your `Stack` [with a `NavigationContainer`](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started#wrapping-your-app-in-navigationcontainer).

### Create your first Stack

- [ ] Read the [`Stack.Navigator` documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/hello-react-navigation).
- [ ] Create a Stack Navigator in `./src/navigation/Navigator.tsx` that shows the `LoginScreen` and the `TermsScreen`.

**Hint:** You can have multiple `function`s in the same file.

### Navigate to another screen

Do you remeber the `<Text>` "by login you accept the Terms and Conditions."? We will use the `navigate()` function to go to another screen.

- [ ] Wrap the terms link with a

```javascript
<TouchableOpacity onPress={navigateToTerms}>
  ...
</TouchableOpacity>
```

Here is a function to navigate between screens:

```javascript
function navigateToTerms() {
  navigation.navigate('Terms');
}
```

- [ ] Add a `goBack` behavior on `TermsScreen.tsx`

### Options for screens

- [ ] On the `TermsScreen`, we have an issue with the double header, we can fix it with some options within the `Navigator`

```javascript
<Stack.Navigator screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }}>
  ...
</Stack.Navigator>
```
