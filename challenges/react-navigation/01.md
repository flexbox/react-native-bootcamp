# React Navigation

## What you will learn

- Routing and navigation for your React Native apps

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- There are others routing solutions available, keep in mind **we are using [`react-navigation` library](https://reactnavigation.org/)**
- We are using the last version of `react-navigation` (Be carreful when you randomly copy/paste Stack Overflow)
- TypeScript definitions are a bit complicated with `react-navigation` just ignore them or add `any`.

Here is a preview of our application UX:

## 📡 Installation

**Hint:** You can read the [Getting started](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/getting-started).

```console
yarn add @react-navigation/native
```

```console
expo install react-native-screens react-native-safe-area-context
```

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 1

**Hint:** You can read the [stack-navigator documentation](https://reactnavigation.org/docs/stack-navigator/).

- [ ] Create a "sitemap" of all your routes

```javascript
// ./src/navigation/AppRoutes.ts

export enum AppRoutes {
  LOGIN_SCREEN = 'Login',
  TERMS_SCREEN = 'Terms',
  STARSHIP_FEED_SCREEN = 'Starships',
  STARSHIP_DETAIL_SCREEN = 'Starship',
  PILOT_SCREEN = 'Pilot',
}
```

- [ ] Create a Stack Navigator in `./src/navigation/Navigator.tsx` that shows the `LoginScreen` and the `TermsScreen`
- [ ] Use `LOGIN_SCREEN` and `TERMS_SCREEN` from `AppRoutes.ts`as route names to maintain consistency when navigating
- [ ] Wrap your `Stack` with a `NavigationContainer`

**Hint:** You can have multiple `function`s in the same file.

- [ ] Update the **entry point of your application**.

**Hint:** If you are lost you can debug the changes on the `NavigationContainer` with:

```javascript
onStateChange={state => console.log('New state is', state)}
```

- [ ] We have an issue with the double header, we can fix it with some options to the `Navigator`

```javascript
headerMode={'none'}
mode={'modal'}
initialRouteName={AppRoutes.LOGIN_SCREEN}
```

- [ ] Wrap the terms link with a `<TouchableOpacity onPress={navigateToTerms}>...</TouchableOpacity>`

Here is a function to navigate between screens:

```javascript
function navigateToTerms() {
  navigation.navigate(AppRoutes.TERMS_SCREEN);
}
```

- [ ] Add a `goBack` behavior on `TermsScreen.tsx`
