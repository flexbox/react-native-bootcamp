# React Native Data Management

📱 Works only on a smartphone.

## 📡 What you will learn

- Add offline feedback message
- Use an advanced React Pattern: [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- [ ] We are going to install and use `react-native-offline`
- [ ] Have a look at [`react-native-offline` documentation](https://github.com/rgommezz/react-native-offline)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3

![Offline Example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactgraphqlacademy/twitter-clone-native/master/src/exercice/05/offline-example.gif)

- [ ] Install the library

```console
yarn add react-native-offline
```

- [ ] Update the entry point of your application to add a new provider

```javascript
import { NetworkProvider } from 'react-native-offline';
```

`NetworkProvider` will injects the network state to children components via [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

- [ ] Create a new file `ScreenContainer.tsx` and [paste this component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/src/components/exercice/ScreenContainer.tsx)
- [ ] Create a new file `Offline.tsx` and and [paste this component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/src/components/exercice/Offline.tsx)
- [ ] On `Offline.tsx` display a message when the user is not connected

**Hint:** Use `!isConnected` to check if the feature works when you are online.
