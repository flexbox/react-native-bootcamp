# Add an `Offline` component

📱 Works only on a smartphone.

## 📡 What you will learn

- Add offline feedback message
- Use an advanced React Pattern: [Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- [ ] We are going to install and use `@react-native-community/netinfo`
- [ ] Have a look at [`@react-native-community/netinfo` documentation](https://github.com/react-native-netinfo/react-native-netinfo)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3

- [ ] Install the library

```console
npm install --save @react-native-community/netinfo
```
```console
yarn add @react-native-community/netinfo
```

- [ ] Create a new file `Network.tsx` and [paste this component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/src/components/exercice/Network.tsx)

You can use console.log to check if the user is connected to the internet.

- [ ] Update the entry point of your application to add a new provider

```javascript
import { NetworkProvider } from '@/contexts/Network';
```

`NetworkProvider` will injects the network state to children components via [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html).

- [ ] Create a new file `ScreenContainer.tsx` and [paste this component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/src/components/exercice/ScreenContainer.tsx)
- [ ] Create a new file `Offline.tsx` and and [paste this component](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/src/components/exercice/Offline.tsx)
- [ ] On `Offline.tsx` display a message when the user is not connected

**🔭 Hint:** Use `!isConnected` to check if the feature works when you are online.
