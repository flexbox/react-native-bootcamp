I think you may have a question at this point.

> Master Yoda, How can I use `debugger`, `console.log()`, and React Developer Tools?

## üì° What you will learn

- Learn how to debug your React Native project.
- Simulate network condition.

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- [ ] Google Chrome needs to be installed on your machine.

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 01

Like websites, you can use Chrome DevTools to debug the `JavaScript` code of your app. You can launch it with `j` in the terminal.

```bash
‚Ä∫ Press j ‚îÇ open debugger
‚Ä∫ Press r ‚îÇ reload app
‚Ä∫ Press m ‚îÇ toggle menu
```

You can explore the `JavaScript` source code of your app, set breakpoints, and inspect variables.

### Debugging `JavaScript`

There are 2 most common ways to debug JavaScript in Chrome DevTools:

- `console.log()` is used to log information to the console, allowing you to see the value of variables and the flow of your code.
- The `debugger` statement is used to pause your code and inspect it in real-time using the DevTools debugger.

Try to use them both in your app. `debugger` is super useful to inspect the state of your app.

### Debugging React with React Developer Tools

The React Developer Tools extension for Chrome and Firefox lets you inspect a React component tree with your browser‚Äôs developer tools.

- [ ] Use `Shift + m` to "Start React devtools"
- [ ] Inspect your React component tree and change the Text from your button.

### Testing your app with bad network

- [ ] Simulate a network connection
  - Go to the **Network tab** of your React Native debugger.
  - You can simulate a network connection by **clicking on the ‚ÄúNo throttling‚Äù dropdown**.
  - You can choose among presets such as **2G or 3G**.

| Command                                     | macOS                  | Windows / Linux  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ---------------- |
| Toggle Developer Tools                      | `control + command + z` | `ctrl + alt + z` |
| Reload the app                              | `r`                    | `r`              |

## üëΩ Bonus

- [ ] To debug native code, network traffic and more, [you can use Flipper](https://fbflipper.com/).
- [ ] [Reactotron](https://github.com/infinitered/reactotron) is another tool created by the fantastic Infinite Red Team.
