# Fetching data with `react-query`

![ReactQuery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/assets/react-query.png)

## üì° What you will learn

- Fetch data over the network from the Star Wars API.
- Display status and datas with `useQuery`.
- Use an advanced React Pattern: [Context API](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context).
- Build [your own custom hook](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks).

## üëæ Before we start the exercise

- [ ] You should have a look at [the SWAPI documentation](https://swapi.py4e.com/)

**While many developers underestimate the complexity associated with asynchronous calls, they are a very large and complex problem (handling load state, error state, cache, refetch)**.

**A simple, high-performance integration can be very tricky**.

We are going to [use `TanStack Query`, here is a video explaining why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=novnyCaa7To).

> React Query is presented as a library of hooks for loading, caching, and modifying asynchronous data in React. It offers many features: a simple query with error and load status, dependent or parallel queries, and paged queries. It also includes simple and efficient cache management and ensures compatibility with server-side rendering, notably Next.js.

Here's how it works:

1. Write your data fetching functions (_here it's `getDataFromApi`_).
1. Wrap them in a named query with `queryKey` as an array of `string` (_here it's `["dataFromApi"]`_).
1. `react-query` handles caching, deduping, re-fetching, and loading states.

```javascript
// READ AND ADAPT; DO NOT MONKEY COPY/PASTE ME

/**
 * Fetches data from an API endpoint and returns the JSON response.
 * @returns {Promise<Object>} A promise that resolves to the JSON response from the API.
 */
async function getDataFromApi() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/collection/`);
    const json = await response.json();
    return json;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error("Something bad happened with the api‚Ä¶");
  }
}

/**
 * Renders a component that fetches data from an API and displays it.
 */
function Component() {
  const { isLoading, isError, data } = useQuery(["dataFromApi"], getDataFromApi);

  if (isLoading) {
    return <Text>Loading‚Ä¶</Text>;
  }
  if (isError) {
    return <Text>Something bad happened‚Ä¶</Text>;
  }

  return <DoStuffWithData data={data} />;
}
```

## üë®‚ÄçüöÄ Exercise 2

That's the screen we will create: a list of data

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reactgraphqlacademy/twitter-clone-native/master/src/exercice/05/starships.png" width="50%" height="50%" />

### Setup `react-query`

- [ ] Install the library

```console
npm install @tanstack/react-query
```

- [ ] Add a `QueryClientProvider` and wrap the application entry point.

**üî≠ Hint:** You can have a look at the [`QueryClientProvider` documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/reference/QueryClientProvider#queryclientprovider)

### Fetching resources across the network

- [ ] Take 5 min to **read carefully** the [`useQuery` documentation](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/queries).

The logic is:

1. `fetch` data from the endpoint and return the result as a `json`
1. Get the result from the fetch and return the result of `useQuery`
1. render the UI

Using the `useQuery` hook and `fetchStarshipsData`, fetch data from the Star Wars API:

```javascript
async function fetchStarshipsData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://swapi.py4e.com/api/starships/`);
    const json = await response.json();
    return json;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error("Something bad happened with the api‚Ä¶");
  }
}
```

- [ ] Use the hook to **display a loading message**.
- [ ] Use the hook to **handle errors**.
- [ ] Use the hook to replace `data.json` and **render data** with a `FlatList`.

## üëΩ Bonus

### Custom Hooks

In the previous challenge `useQuery`, `isPending` and `isError` lives on the same files. To have a more robust application, and separte the concerns of the data and the ui, we can wrap our queries into one custom hook `useStarships()`.

- [ ] Create a new file `useStarships.ts` and paste the content bellow

```javascript
// ./src/hooks/useStarships.ts
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

async function fetchStarshipsData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://swapi.py4e.com/api/starships/`);
    const json = await response.json();
    return json;
  } catch (error) {
    throw new Error("Something bad happened with the api‚Ä¶");
  }
}

export function useStarships() {
  return useQuery({ queryKey: ["starships"], queryFn: fetchStarshipsData} );
}
```

Now you can write `useStarships()` anywhere in your Screen and React Query handles the rest.

If you want to display some images on your `Card`, you can use this placeholder `https://picsum.photos/400/200` as a `source`.

### Advanced

- [ ] Display a nice animated placeholder during loading by choosing one of these approaches:
  - Option 1: Use [rn-placeholder](https://github.com/mfrachet/rn-placeholder) for quick implementation
    - ‚ö†Ô∏è If using npm, install with: `npm install rn-placeholder --legacy-peer-deps` (required due to outdated peer dependencies)
  - Option 2: Use [react-native-reanimated](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/) to create your own animated placeholder, similar to our [`SkeletonListReanimated`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-bootcamp/main/hackathon/spacecraft/src/components/SkeletonListReanimated.tsx) component

- [ ] Add a "Pull to Refresh" functionality to your FlatList with `onRefresh`

### Debugging

- [ ] Add [`expo-dev-tools`](https://docs.expo.dev/debugging/devtools-plugins/#expo-dev-tools-plugins) to your project
- [ ] Add [`@dev-plugins/react-query`](https://docs.expo.dev/debugging/devtools-plugins/#react-query)
