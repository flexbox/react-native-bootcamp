/**
 * Adapts focus styles based on the user's active input modality (i.e., how
 * they are interacting with the UI right now).
 *
 * Focus styles are only relevant when using the keyboard to interact with the
 * page. If we only show the focus ring when relevant, we can avoid user
 * confusion without compromising accessibility.
 *
 * The script uses two heuristics to determine whether the keyboard is being used:
 *
 * 1. a keydown event occurred immediately before a focus event;
 * 2. a focus event happened on an element which requires keyboard interaction (e.g., a text field);
