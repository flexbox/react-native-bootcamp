/**
 * A component that allows you to configure your status bar without directly calling imperative
 * methods like `setBarStyle`.
 *
 * You will likely have multiple `StatusBar` components mounted in the same app at the same time.
 * For example, if you have multiple screens in your app, you may end up using one per screen.
 * The props of each `StatusBar` component will be merged in the order that they were mounted.
 * This component is built on top of the [StatusBar](https://reactnative.dev/docs/statusbar)
 * component exported from React Native, and it provides defaults that work better for Expo users.
