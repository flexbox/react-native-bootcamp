        <Title>1. Account</Title>
        <Text>
          A TOR Account ("Account") may be required to access and use TOR
          Services. If you have questions about Account registration, please
          contact us by visiting http://www.swtor.com/support. To create a TOR
          Account, you must have an email address, and provide truthful and
          accurate information. TOR Accounts are available only to adults, or in
          their discretion, their minor child. If you are a minor, your parent
          or guardian must complete the registration process, in which case he
          or she takes full responsibility for all obligations under this Terms
          of Service. TOR Accounts will not be allowed for minors under thirteen
          (13) years of age, regardless of permission and/or registration by
          such minor's parent or guardian. You must be eligible to use the TOR
          Service for which you are registering. Some TOR Services may require
          creation of a ["User Name" or "Persona"]. [User names or Personas] are
          tied to your Account. You may not use a ["User Name" or "Persona"]
          that is used by someone else, is vulgar or offensive, or otherwise
          violates the Terms of Service. You are solely responsible for all
          activity on your Account. Your Account may be terminated if someone
          else uses it to engage in activity that violates the Terms of Service
          or is otherwise improper or illegal. You should not reveal your
          Account password to others. BioWare and LucasArts will not ask you to
          reveal your password, or ever initiate any contact with you asking for
          your password reminder words.

        <Title>2. Service</Title>
        <Text>

          and pay the subscription or other fees to participate in these
          activities. Information about subscription and other fees for TOR
          Services is published in the relevant pages at
