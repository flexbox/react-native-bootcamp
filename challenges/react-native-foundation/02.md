# React Native Foundations

## What you will learn

- Use the `expo-cli`
- Install a library with `yarn`

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

- You should have VSCode on your laptop
- You should have the [`expo-cli` installed](https://docs.expo.io/get-started/installation/)
- Have a look at the [scrollview documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview)

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 2 - Use VSCode to code from your computer

- [ ] On your terminal create a new application with

```console
expo init spacecraft -t expo-template-blank-typescript
```

- [ ] On your terminal

```console
yarn add react-native-paper
```

- [ ] Paste your LoginScreen from the exercice 1 Snack into `App.tsx`

Congratulations 👏! You should have something like this:

![Login Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-native-foundation/login.png)

Now we are going to create another Screen. Fell free to kill/relaunch the expo server if you encounter errors.

- [ ] Rename `App.tsx` to `LoginScreen.tsx`
- [ ] Create a new file `App.tsx` and paste the content [from this TermsScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/challenges/react-native-foundation/spacecraft/TermsScreen.tsx)
- [ ] Fix the `View` bug, it can't display all the content.

### 👽 Bonus

- [ ] Create your custom `TextInput` and `Button` component
