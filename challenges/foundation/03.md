# Scroll on mobile

## 📡 What you will learn

- What is a `<Fragment>` component.
- Add a simple `<ScrollView>`.

## 👾 Before we start the exercise

We **are not going to explore how the navigation works** in this exercice. For now, we need to update the routing manually and change exported screens.

Here is an example of the entry point of our application:

```javascript
// App.tsx

import React from "react";
import { LoginScreen } from "./src/screens/LoginScreen";
import { TermsScreen } from "./src/screens/TermsScreen";

function App() {
  return (
    // <LoginScreen />
    <TermsScreen />
  );
};

// always export default App otherwise Expo is not happy
export default App;
```

**🔭 Hint:** One important thing to mention: **React can export only one child**. If you have this error `JSX expressions must have one parent element` use a [React Fragment](https://react.dev/reference/react/Fragment) or a `<View>` to wrap all your elements.

You can use React Fragments by wrapping your child elements to be returned by your component with a `<React.Fragment>`. Returning to the example above, the `LoginScreen` component would be written like this:

```javascript
export function LoginScreen() {
  return (
    <>
      <TextInput />
      <TextInput />
      <Button>Login</Button>
    </>
  );
};
```

React Fragments can also be employed with a short syntax, which looks like an empty tag:

```javascript
export function LoginScreen() {
  return (
    // using <> is just like using <React.Fragment>
    <>
      <TextInput />
      <TextInput />
      <Button>Login</Button>
    </>
    // using </> is just like using </React.Fragment>
  );
};
```

We are using Fragment to avoid unnecessary `<View>` markup.

## 👨‍🚀 Exercise 3

### Allow users to Scroll content

- [ ] Have a look at the [`ScrollView` documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview)
- [ ] Create a new file `./src/screens/TermsScreen.tsx` paste the content [from this TermsScreen](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flexbox/react-native-workshop/main/hackathon/spacecraft/src/screens/exercice/TermsScreen.tsx)
- [ ] Fix the `View` bug with a `ScrollView` because it can't display all the content.
